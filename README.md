# Data for [PhyloProfile](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile)

The above 4 text files (<code>idList.txt, rankList.txt, taxonomyMatrix.txt</code> and <code>taxonNamesReduced.txt</code>) will be automatically downloaded into **_data_** folder of [PhyloProfile](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile) when user runs the tool for the first time. They contains pre-calculated taxonomy information for about 644 taxa. Depend on the input taxa list, new information will be added into those files.

In `demo` and `expTestData/ampk-tor` folders you can find the online demo files, which are used when the option **Use online demo data** in `Input & settings` page is chosen.

`expTestData` folder contains three real experimental data sets that can be downloaded and manually given to PhyloProfile.

- `NIHMS656878.txt.zip`: phylogenetic profile spans 31,406 human genes and 177 species generated from the study of [Dey et al (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5016211/).

- `lca_microsporidia.zip`: phylogenetic data for 1605 last common ancestor Microsporidia genes across 231 species, which were a subset of data used for testing [the performance of PhyloProfile](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile/wiki/Performance-test).

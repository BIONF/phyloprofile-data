# Test Data for [PhyloProfile Tool](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile)

This folder contains some experimental data for testing *PhyloProfile*:

- `ampk-tor.zip`: phylogenetic profile of AMPK-TOR pathway, which is based on the work of [Roustan et. al (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erw211). The corresponding folder `ampk-tor` contains the same data, which are used for **Use online demo data** function *(in Input and settings page of PhyloProfile tool)*.

- `NIHMS656878.txt.zip`: phylogenetic profile spans 31,406 human genes and 177 species generated from the study of [Dey et al (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5016211/).

- `lca_microsporidia.zip`: phylogenetic data for 1605 last common ancestor Microsporidia genes across 231 species, which were a subset of data used for testing [the performance of PhyloProfile](https://github.com/BIONF/PhyloProfile/wiki/Performance-test).
